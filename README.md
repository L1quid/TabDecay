Tab Decay
========

A Chrome extension which bookmarks and closes tabs that have been unused for days.  A supporting web service saves HTML and PNG copies of the closed web pages, providing an archive in case the pages disappear from the web.

Tab Decay does not close pinned tabs, nor those hosting pages provided by the browser ("chrome://" etc).

** This extension is not ready for use. **

Why this exists
---------------

I often open tabs with the intention of going back to them, be it for casual reading, research, or coding reference.  A lot of the time, these tabs are forgotten about and, since I rarely close my browser, this results in a big mess o' tabs which eventually can't even show their titles or favicons.  Thus the idea of decaying tabs was born.

Unused tabs will now be bookmarked and closed automatically every couple of days, ensuring I don't lose any pages I might want to go back and read while freeing up space for more tabs!
