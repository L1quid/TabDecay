TabDecay
========

A Chrome extension which bookmarks and closes tabs that have been unused for days.

Why this exists
---------------

I often open tabs with the intention of going back to them, be it for casual reading, research, or coding reference.  A lot of the time, these tabs are forgotten about and, since I rarely close my browser, this results in a big mess o' tabs which eventually don't have room to show title or favicon.  Thus the idea of decaying tabs was born.

Unused tabs will now be bookmarked and closed automatically every couple of days, ensuring I don't lose any pages I might want to go back and read while freeing up space for more tabs!
