Tab Decay
========

A Chrome extension which bookmarks and closes unused tabs.

Decay
-----

Users define a time period, and tabs which are unused for that time period are then decayed (bookmarked, archived, closed).

Bookmarking
-----------

Saves bookmarks in folders by date of last activity.  Open a URL on 2013-01-01; when closed by Tab Decay, the bookmark is placed in Decayed Tabs -> 2013-01-01.

Archival
--------

The Tab Decay web service provides a backend for storing HTML archives and PNG screenshots of pages, ensuring users have access to pages even if the original site goes offline.

Exceptions
----------

Tab Decay does not act on Chrome system and pinned tabs.  A whitelist feature is also planned.
